                        I currently reside in Austin, Texas with my husband and two loving dogs. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2014 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and I am currently a Property Manager for office buildings. I recently earned a certificate in full stack web development from The University of Texas at Austin with newly developed skills in JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, MySQL, CSS, and HTML. For our final project, our team of three built a single-page MERN stack application that allows users to sign-up and request for help and/or volunteer to help within their community. I am a hard working, dedicated and resourceful individual who is excited to leverage my skills in a fast-paced environment. I am looking to be part of a quality-driven team that builds applications with great user experience. Iâ€™m very open to learning new technology and I am willing to put in the hours to meet deadlines. I am very passionate about React and would love to find a position where I can continue to grow my knowledge and skills working with React.
